# Hey there :wave:

Welcome on my GitHub Profile ! :wink:

## About me :eyes:

I'm Dorian, I was a chemistry technician and now I'm a french Web Developper looking for a job / traineeship ! :computer: :star:
I did my reconversion cursus at [@oclock_io](https://twitter.com/Oclock_io) with my favorite promotion ! :man_student: :man_astronaut:

I would like to thank them for all they did for me ! :bow:

## Languages and Tools :hammer_and_wrench:

In this cursus, I learnt a lot of techologies and tools in order to become a Fullstack JavaScript Developer :dizzy: :

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Redux](https://redux.js.org/))
- SQL / NoSQL ([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/))
- API REST with [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- API [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [Apollo-Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
- Caching with [Redis](https://redis.io/)

But as Web Developpers, we are not stopping to study, we are always learning things ! :books:

:seedling: Now, I'm sharpening my JavaScript skills and I'm learning Python for Data Science on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).
:construction_worker_man: I'm currently working on my project "Mur des Pens√©es" and I'm deploying a new Virtual Machine for my developement environment.:penguin:
